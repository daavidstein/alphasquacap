## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
test <- read.csv("/Users/james/Desktop/Screenshots/test_csv.csv")

names(test) <- c("year", "arrivals", "departures", "na")

head(test)


ATL <- test %>%
    select(year, arrivals, departures) %>%
    mutate(year = str_extract(year, "[0-9]+"), 
           arrivals = str_extract(arrivals, "[0-9]+"), 
           departures = str_extract(arrivals, "[0-9]+")) %>%
    mutate_all(as.numeric) %>%
    mutate(ops = arrivals + departures)
    

ggplot(ATL, aes(x = year, y = ops)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1987, 2018, 5)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(size = .25) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 2006, color = alpha("darkred", .5)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 2012, color = alpha("blue", .5)) +
    labs(title = "Total Arrivals + Departures Per Year in ATL", 
         subtitle = "Verticle lines represent major expansions: $1.35B and $1.28B",
         color = "Expansion",
         x = "Year", 
         y = "Total Arrivals + Departures")


max(ATL$year)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for exam"ple:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
